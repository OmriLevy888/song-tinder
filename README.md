# Song Tinder
Heard of tinder? Heard of music? They had a match!

## Description
Song Tinder aims to ease the pain of managing song playlists. This is done by
mainly focusing on a Tinder-like swipe card based interface which can be used
for anything from sorting your existing playlists to finding new music.

Using the three swipe directions; right, left and up you can choose whether to
add a song to your default playlist, skip the song entirely or add the song to
multiple playlists respectively. Both the default playlsit and the list of
playlists shown when swiping uo can be configured at any time.

Another strength of Song Tinder is the source of the songs. Song Tinder works
with both Apple Music and Spotify. The songs in the stack can be configured to
be pulled from a combination of different sources:
- User library
- Playlists
- Artists/Albums
- Genre/Time range
- Random/Recomended
